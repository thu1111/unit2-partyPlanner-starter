# Demo - Party Planner

**NOTE:** The `main` branch of this repo is the starting point for the guided practice!

This demo uses the same party API as the previous workshop. A list of all parties is shown. When a user clicks on a specific party, the page is updated to show the details of that party. The selected party persists even if the user refreshes the page.

The main focus of this demo is to:

- Demonstrate how clicking a link changes the URL hash, which in turn triggers a state change
- Provide an example of how a URL hash can be used to store the current state of the application
- Reinforce the state -> UI paradigm
